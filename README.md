# jjs105/shared

A simple repository for shared/common scripts/libraries etc.

## Background

There doesn't seem to be a best-practice/agreed apon way to share arbtrary code/scripts/libraries etc. between multiple (repository based) projects.

Some of the options available are listed below but all ahve their own pros- and cons-

* Copy & Paste / Manual Management
* Build Systems (e.g. Bit) or Sync systems
* Monorepos
* Published Packages (e.g. npm, yarn)
* Git sub-modules or sub-trees
* Bespoke Scripts

## Aim

The aim of this repository is to provide a centralised location for my personal scripts etc. that I will, or am likely to, need across multiple projects.

This means that the repository itself will be language and technology agnostic and is likely to contain some or all of the following:

* Bash scripts and libraries
* Text based notes etc.
* Common code libraries (multiple languages)
* Common configuration files
* Template files

The hope is that whichever or whatever approach to the actual sharing between projects is chosen will be supported by this centralised location.
